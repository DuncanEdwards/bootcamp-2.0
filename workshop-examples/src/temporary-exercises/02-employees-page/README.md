### First emploeye exercise

There is an endpoint in the `players-api` project called `/employees` which returns employee data (try it!)

1. Your first mission is to create an `Employee` type to model this data
2. Create an `EmployeesTable` component that can display a list of Employees (use MUI table - https://mui.com/material-ui/react-table/)
